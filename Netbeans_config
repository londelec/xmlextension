In order to prepare the project for Netbeans 7.4 IDE please follow 
instructions below if experiencing any problems. These project setting
adjustements were required in following system configuration:
	* Netbeans IDE 7.4
	* Apache OpenOffice API plugin 3.0.0.beta
	* LibreOffice & SDK 3.5.7
	* JRE (gcj-jre) 4.6.3

================================================================================
Add following JARs to the project libraries
in case some imports can't be resolved:
	/usr/share/java/ridl.jar
	/usr/share/java/jurt.jar
	/usr/share/java/juh.jar

Some projects settings already have these JARs included automatically in the 
'project.properties' file under projects directory 'nbproject'

================================================================================
When project is created from scratch file 'build-uno-impl.xml' 
under projects directory 'nbproject' contains the follwing entry:
    <target name="jar" depends="-uno-project-init,uno-idl-compile,-jar-idl-types,compile,-pre-jar,-do-jar-with-manifest,-do-jar-without-manifest,-do-jar-with-mainclass,-do-jar-with-libraries,-do-openoffice-manifest,-post-jar">

remove these three arguments:
	-do-jar-with-manifest
	-do-jar-without-manifest
	-do-jar-with-mainclass

so the entry looks like this:
    <target name="jar" depends="-uno-project-init,uno-idl-compile,-jar-idl-types,compile,-pre-jar,-do-jar-with-libraries,-do-openoffice-manifest,-post-jar">

This should resolve the issue if project fails to build.
